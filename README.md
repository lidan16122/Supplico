# Supplico
## A delivery application for businesses with a unique way.
Supplico makes it easier for small businesses or companies to make an order of goods without any trouble, for the supplier to publish their products easily, and for a driver to search for available deliveries to take them. <br />
The application has 3 roles: Business, Driver, Supplier. each one with his own purpose to use this application. <br />
To use Supplico you must sign up and be accepted by an admin. <br />
 - Business: can choose any products from any supplier and make an order with just one click. note that businesses can order from one supplier at once.
 - Driver: can search for available deliveries to deliver them.
 - Supplier: can publish his shop and his products to sell for businesses.
Everything is digital and stored in a database. <br />
There is an order display with all the required information, status, who confirmed, sum, pallets, and transaction id. <br />
The business can browse products from available suppliers. <br />
The supplier can create, edit, and delete any products. <br />
The driver has a page for finding an open delivery. <br />
